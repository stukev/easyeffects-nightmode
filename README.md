# ðŸŽµ Quiet Night Mode Preset for EasyEffects

A simple **EasyEffects** preset and an optional **alias** to toggle your audio processing for safe and system wide night time music and video enjoyment.

- Designed for movies and shows at night without waking up the whole house.
- Flattens loudness, compresses peaks but preserves clear sound.
- Lightweight install with a single script and an optional cli command to toggle on/off.

```

Then clone this project:

cd easyeffects-nightmode
bash install.sh
```

The script will:

- Copy the `quiet.json` preset into your EasyEffects output presets folder.
- Optionally create a `quiet` alias in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` to easily toggle Night Mode on/off.
